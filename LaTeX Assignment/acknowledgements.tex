In the spirit of the reference text, I would like to acknowledge the people who made this project possible.
First, I must thank \textbf{our instructor for the SEC \LaTeX\ Course} for providing the clear requirements and the reference materials necessary to complete this assignment.
This project has been an \emph{excellent practical exercise} in document preparation.
I would also like to acknowledge the authors of the original \textit{Deep Learning} book—\textbf{Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville}.
Their comprehensive text served as the \emph{perfect model} for this typesetting project.

Finally, I am grateful for the \textbf{developers of the \LaTeX\ system}, the \textbf{\TeX\ Users Group (TUG)}, and the \textbf{countless individuals} who have created and maintained the packages used in this document, such as \texttt{amsmath}, \texttt{hyperref}, and \texttt{tocbibind}.
Without this \textbf{powerful, free, and open-source ecosystem}, a project of this quality would not be possible.

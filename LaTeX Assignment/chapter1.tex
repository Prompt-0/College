This introductory chapter serves as the primary gateway into
the world of deep learning, arguably the most capable
and fastest-growing approach to modern artificial intelligence.
We begin by defining what artificial intelligence (AI) actually is,
placing machine learning as a subfield of AI that enables systems
to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Deep learning is then presented as a specific, more powerful
type of machine learning that uses "deep" neural networks.
These networks are inspired by the human brain's structure.
The chapter provides a high-level overview of the book's three
main parts: foundations, modern practical models, and research.
We also explore the historical trends that have led to
the current "AI boom," citing the availability of "big data"
and the massive computational power of modern GPUs.
This historical context is crucial for understanding why
deep learning is succeeding now, when similar ideas in the
1980s and 1990s failed to gain traction.
This book is intended for both students and software engineers.
This chapter sets the stage, providing the necessary
motivation and context to understand the deep concepts
that follow, from basic linear algebra to advanced
generative models.

This book is a project for the \textbf{SEC course \LaTeX\ TypeSetting For Beginners} designed to meet the requirements of the \textbf{final \LaTeX\ assignment}.
The primary goal is \emph{not} to create new content, but to demonstrate \textbf{mastery over the \LaTeX\ typesetting system},
specifically its ability to manage \emph{large, multi-file documents} using the \texttt{book} class.
The structure of this document directly mirrors the requirements of the assignment: to build a book complete with a title page, \emph{front matter} (including this preface and acknowledgements), a \emph{main body} containing at least three chapters, and \emph{back matter} featuring a bibliography.

The content itself is sourced from two places. The foundational \emph{"Notation"} chapter is a direct transcription from page 17 of the provided reference text, \textit{Deep Learning} by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.
This exercise demonstrates the handling of \textbf{complex mathematical typesetting}.

The three main chapters—\emph{"Introduction,"} \emph{"Linear Algebra,"} and \emph{"Probability"}—are original abstracts written in the style of the reference book.
Each abstract is over 15 lines, fulfilling the assignment's requirement to \emph{"write about a book you like,"} using the provided \textit{Deep Learning} text as the subject.
This project showcases the use of \texttt{\string\include} and \texttt{\string\input} to manage files, automatic generation of a Table of Contents with \texttt{\string\tableofcontents}, and the inclusion of unnumbered chapters into the ToC using \texttt{\string\addcontentsline}.
